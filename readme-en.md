## Milestones 🌊
- Completely restructured using Next.js, supporting simple deployment on multiple cloud platforms.
	
## Distinctions 🏄🏿‍♂️
+ Better suited for developers familiar with the js/ts tech stack to get started quickly.
+ Free serverless cloud platform deployment.
+ Support for Excalidraw sketches.

## Plans 🌄
+ Implement a code sandbox to support modern, engineered coding practices (coming very soon, the codebase is almost complete).
+ Implement partial update features, similar to V0.
+ i18n

## Deployment 🪤
### Docker
```sh
	docker run -p 3000:3000 jadenxiong/screenshot-to-page:0.12
```
### Vercel
+ Click the button on the right to start deployment: ![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)
+ Once deployed, you can start using it;
+ (Optional) [Bind a custom domain](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/domains/add-a-domain): The DNS of the domain assigned by Vercel is polluted in some regions, binding a custom domain will allow direct connection.
